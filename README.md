PHPJSPong
=========

PHP/JS/jQuery Pong kin to Apache Pong (logstalgia)

Alternative to Apache Pong for server-side log viewing. 


I like Apache Pong, but I didn't like the installation process, so I made my own version, which I entitled PHPJSPong, inspired by Apache Pong. 

It's really easy to install, just copy the files to a directory, set the log URL in the php.php file and the password in the phppong.php file (at the top, at $_REQUEST['u']='password).

After that, go to the page, i.e. mysite.com/phppong.php?u=password and you're done!

This is version 1, but hopefully there will be more in the future, with updates and improvements, like having the pages disappear after they're done showing.
