PHPJSPong
=========

PHP/JS/jQuery Pong kin to Apache Pong (logstalgia)

Alternative to Apache Pong for server-side log viewing. 


Just started. Ran into an error. That is, that $(".pageName.ent0#1401183013") doesn't select \<div class="pageName
ent0" id="1401183013"\>/\</div\> currently but the
$(".ipAdd.ent0#1401183013") selector works fine, so it's not making sense to me. The structure is identical and they're implemented exactly the same way.
